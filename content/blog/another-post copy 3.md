# 🧩 The Power of Standardization: How Doxali Harmonizes Legal Data

Every team has its own stack of documents — leases, loans, NDAs, bylaws. But ask five reviewers to abstract a term, and you’ll get five formats.

That inconsistency slows down reviews, complicates analysis, and makes automation nearly impossible.

**Doxali** fixes that — turning freeform PDFs into consistent, structured data using AI-powered templates.

---

## 🔀 The Problem with “Custom Everything”

In legal ops, custom inputs often lead to messy outputs:

* Different field names for the same concept
* Missing or partial terms buried in appendices
* Handwritten notes or one-off spreadsheets

Even with skilled reviewers, standardization breaks down under pressure.

---

## 🧠 Doxali Brings Order to the Chaos

Doxali uses AI-backed document templates that enforce consistency — across document types and teams.

Each agreement is parsed into pre-defined sections:

* **Loan Docs:** Financial Terms, Defaults, Legal Clauses
* **Leases:** Base Rent, Option Periods, CAM Charges
* **NDA:** Confidentiality Period, Governing Law, Carveouts

No matter who uploads the file — the structure stays the same.

---

## 🔄 From Documents to Datasets

When legal docs follow a consistent structure, you unlock powerful downstream benefits:

* Faster review handoffs across teams
* Cleaner audit trails and compliance records
* Easier integration with databases or analytics tools
* More scalable knowledge management

Doxali acts like a data refinery — transforming raw agreements into refined, usable information.

---

## 📤 Outputs You Can Trust

Once abstracted, data is:

* **Editable** — adjust values in the UI
* **Source-linked** — trace each field to the original text
* **Exportable** — download to Excel in a clean format

This isn't just automation — it’s reliable structure you can build on.

---

Whether you're processing 10 documents a week or 1,000 per month, Doxali supports scalable, repeatable abstraction — without sacrificing precision.

And with over two dozen document types supported out of the box, expanding your workflows is simple.
