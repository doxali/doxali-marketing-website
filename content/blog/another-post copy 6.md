# 🔍 From PDF to Proof: Doxali and the Future of Legal Auditability

In legal and real estate operations, trust isn’t just earned — it’s documented. But when critical deal terms are buried in sprawling PDFs, auditability becomes a manual nightmare.

Enter **Doxali** — an AI-powered abstraction tool that doesn’t just extract data, but **links it back to the source**, making every field traceable and auditable.

## ✅ The Problem with Traditional Document Review

Legal teams and analysts face a common challenge:

* PDFs are unstructured and opaque.
* Manual reviews are time-consuming and error-prone.
* There’s no consistent audit trail for extracted data.

This leaves room for misinterpretation — or worse, missed obligations.

## 🔗 Doxali Builds Trust Through Traceability

Every field abstracted by Doxali includes **a source reference** — a direct connection to the originating clause or section in the uploaded document.

This means:

* Reviewers can verify data instantly.
* No more second-guessing key terms.
* Auditors get a full picture, not just an output file.

## 🧠 AI-Powered, Human-Centric

While Doxali automates the heavy lifting, it keeps humans in the loop. Its UI is designed for clarity:

* Source tooltips appear inline with fields
* Every term is editable and reviewable
* Exhibits and attachments are tracked with status indicators

The result? A workflow that feels as trustworthy as it is fast.
