# 🏗️ AI-Powered Diligence: A Smarter Way to Review Legal Docs

Due diligence is the heartbeat of every transaction — but it’s often slowed by the same roadblock: the documents. Hundreds of pages. Scattered terms. Unstructured data.

That’s where **Doxali** comes in — a new kind of AI assistant purpose-built to abstract legal documents with speed, clarity, and precision.

---

## 💼 Why Diligence Needs an Upgrade

Whether you’re:

* Acquiring a multifamily asset
* Syndicating a portfolio loan
* Conducting buy-side legal review

…the bottleneck is always the same: **unstructured PDFs and too little time.**

Analysts and attorneys spend hours parsing leases, loan docs, and title policies — often with incomplete data and no audit trail.

---

## 🤖 Doxali Transforms the Workflow

Instead of reading line-by-line, users upload their PDFs to Doxali and receive structured data in moments:

* Grouped fields by category (e.g., financial terms, covenants, legal conditions)
* Source-linked tooltips for every extracted clause
* Editable values for human review
* Export to Excel for diligence checklists or internal models

What used to take days now fits inside a coffee break.

---

## 🧱 Built for Transactions

Doxali supports the core documents behind every real estate or finance deal:

* **Lease Agreements**
* **Purchase & Sale Agreements (PSAs)**
* **Loan Packages**
* **Title Policies**
* **Appraisals and SNDAs**

Each type has a tailored interface — optimized for accuracy and reviewer focus.

---

## 🌐 Collaborative by Nature

Modern diligence is rarely solo. Teams spread across cities (or continents) need tools that support:

* **Remote review** with traceable fields
* **Consistent abstraction logic** across users and deals
* **Clean exports** for investment memos or redline meetings

Doxali fits directly into that environment — lightweight, web-based, and fast.
