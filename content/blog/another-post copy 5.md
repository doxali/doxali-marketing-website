# ⏱️ Speed Matters: How Doxali Shrinks Document Review Time from Days to Minutes

Deadlines are non-negotiable. But when legal documents are dozens of pages long and loaded with fine print, review teams are often racing against the clock.

**Doxali** changes the equation — turning multi-hour reviews into a matter of minutes through instant, AI-powered abstraction.

---

## 🐢 The Traditional Grind

Reviewing a complex lease or loan agreement the old way means:

* Scanning 50+ pages for key terms
* Manually entering values into spreadsheets
* Double-checking everything — twice

For time-strapped analysts or legal teams, this isn’t just tedious. It’s a bottleneck.

---

## ⚡ Enter Doxali

Doxali enables you to:

1. **Select a document type**
2. **Upload a PDF**
3. **Review structured data — instantly**

Each abstraction is categorized, source-linked, and ready for export — no more flipping pages or guessing where that late fee clause was hiding.

---

## 🔄 From Hours to Minutes

Let’s say you have ten loan agreements to review by EOD. With traditional workflows, that’s a full day (or two) of work.

With Doxali:

* You upload all ten
* Each one is abstracted in seconds
* You review and export within the hour

That’s a **10x reduction in turnaround time** — without sacrificing accuracy.

---

## 📁 Real-Time Cost Awareness

Before committing, Doxali even estimates:

* Page count
* Token volume (AI workload)
* Processing cost

You know exactly what to expect before you hit “upload.”

* **Underwriting teams** with compressed diligence timelines
* **Legal departments** handling recurring agreements at volume
* **Advisors and brokers** working across multiple deal types

Whether you’re abstracting one doc or 100, Doxali keeps pace.
